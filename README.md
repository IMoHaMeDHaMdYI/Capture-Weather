## Coroutines for a single network call ? DI for a couble of dependencies ? 
**Such a use of big libraries for a small app is considered overkilling, I know that, but in real life there is no such a small app, and I need to show what I know.**

## Libraries:
*  Coroutines
*  Retrofit
*  Moshi
*  Koin
*  [CameraView](https://github.com/natario1/CameraView)
*  Glide
*  Architecture Components
